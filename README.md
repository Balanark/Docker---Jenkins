🐳 Flask + Docker + Jenkins CI/CD Pipeline (AWS)
This project demonstrates a simple yet complete DevOps automation using:

Flask web application

Docker containerization

Jenkins CI/CD pipeline

AWS EC2 as infrastructure

GitHub as source control

The goal is to showcase how a full CI/CD system can be implemented in the cloud, without the need for local tools like Docker or Jenkins.
